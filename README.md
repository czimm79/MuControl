# MuControl
MuControl is a self-contained application intended for the manipulation and monitoring of electric signals for
3D electromagnet systems. The goal of this app is to:

1. Output calculated signals to a *National Instruments (NI)* function generator to create a constant magnitude
   rotating 3-D magnetic field
2. Monitor the signals using a data acquisition card (NI) and resistor array (physical setup not covered in this guide)
   by plotting the input live
3. Allow for field parameters to be easily adjusted by using a graphical user interface, keyboard, or gamepad
4. Eliminate the need for the user to have any coding knowledge
5. Provide easy to understand visualizations
6. Eliminate the performance issues and frequent crashes of MATLAB
7. Provide a platform that can be extended with more features and advanced functionality (gradient tracking,
   computer vision, corkscrew modalities)

## Version 0.9.9
Fully complete application. For version 1.0.0 include documentation and conduct some quality control to
smash any persisting bugs.
